# Welcome to the Sonata Project

We are building an ecosystem of software with the sole purpose of empowering developers around the world to build better applications, faster. If you are an individual, this means less lines of code to make something significant. If you are a business or startup, it means a tremendous save of money with expertise.

We are convinced that a small team of talented people with the right set of tools or even an individual can be better than a whole room full of lazy developers struggling with their own tools. No one should be paying big sums of money just for getting state management done right or to set a simple REST server running.

Let you or your employees be creative.

## Know how we are revolutionizing the Fullstack

Our two main projects are:

### [Sonata API](https://github.com/sonata-api/sonata-api)

We make the backend better by reducing drastically the code surface of it. Declare things that are stored on the database using a JSON Schema superset, create the functions to be called on endpoints, define how the API resources should be accessed by users using the Access Control, and that is it. Jump straight to the business logic in a matter of minutes.

### [Waltz UI](https://github.com/sonata-api/waltz-ui)

A simplified version of the backend should have it's matching frontend library. Waltz UI is made on top of Vue with a powerful set of builtin components and utilities a handful of dynamic runtime rendering to let you setup a beautiful, colaboration-friendly frontend with tiny bundle sizes.
